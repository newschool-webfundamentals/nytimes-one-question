          <p>We weren’t too surprised that most people didn’t know the exact jobless rate; most people aren’t economists. What was truly intriguing was that so many people answered in the completely wrong direction.</p>
          <p>
            We set out wanting to learn about people’s perceptions of the value of college, now nearly seven years after the recession, when a big supply of college graduates and low demand for work had made the case for college seem weaker. Late last year, we asked Google Consumer Surveys to ask Americans about college costs, wages after college, and unemployment rates of college graduates and nongraduates.
          </p>
          <p>The really interesting result was how people answered the jobless rate questions.</p>
          <p>We asked: “What would you guess is the current unemployment rate for four-year college graduates between the ages of 25 and 34?” We also asked the same question, phrased the same way, but about high school graduates.</p>
          <p>Initially, people were way off. The most common answers for college graduates were between 20 and 30 percent. Perhaps an understandable mistake: The question was open-ended, and maybe lots of people don’t know exactly how an unemployment rate is defined (it doesn’t include people who aren’t looking for jobs). But what surprised us was that the majority of people thought that unemployment rates for those with college degrees were higher than for those without.</p>
          <p>We were so surprised that we thought we had done something wrong. Maybe we asked the question unclearly, or perhaps people weren’t thinking about unemployment rates consistently. So we ran the survey again, this time with a point of reference to anchor them. Our focus this time was figuring out whether people were completely mistaken about the effect of a college degree on one’s chances of having a job.</p>
