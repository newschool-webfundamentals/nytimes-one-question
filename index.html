        <p>Have you been following the news? Take our quiz to see what you know and to learn more.</p>

        <p>Last week, most of you — 89 percent or above — answered the questions about the World Series, the third presidential debate, the migrant crisis and AT&T correctly, and you knew that “FEC Extends Election by 7 Months to Give Nation Chance to Better Get to Know Candidates” had to be the fake news item in the 10th question.</p>

        <p>This week, however, our Halloween-themed 10th question is a bit trickier. Read carefully and employ the method a seventh-grade class in Brooklyn told us it uses to get the answer right most of the time: “We have heated discussions and debates and work together to figure out the answers.”</p>

        <h3>In a breathless month full of political bombshells, the phrase _________, first used by The Times in 1980, has become a regular part of the news lexicon. By the strictest definition, the phrase means news specifically (and cynically) timed by one side or another to sway an election, with evidence that it changed voters’ minds and moved the polls. More loosely, the term is applied to any big, late development, deliberate or not, perhaps even ones that show no sign of altering the outcome.</h3>
